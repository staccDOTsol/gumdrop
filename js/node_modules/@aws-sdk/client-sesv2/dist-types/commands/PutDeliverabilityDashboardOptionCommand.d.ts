/**
 * <p>Enable or disable the Deliverability dashboard. When you enable the Deliverability dashboard, you gain
 *             access to reputation, deliverability, and other metrics for the domains that you use to
 *             send email. You also gain the ability to perform predictive inbox placement tests.</p>
 *
 *         <p>When you use the Deliverability dashboard, you pay a monthly subscription charge, in addition
 *             to any other fees that you accrue by using Amazon SES and other Amazon Web Services services. For more
 *             information about the features and cost of a Deliverability dashboard subscription, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/ses/pricing/">Amazon SES Pricing</a>.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SESv2Client, PutDeliverabilityDashboardOptionCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SESv2Client, PutDeliverabilityDashboardOptionCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SESv2Client(config);
 * const command = new PutDeliverabilityDashboardOptionCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link PutDeliverabilityDashboardOptionCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link PutDeliverabilityDashboardOptionCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SESv2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for SESv2Client's `config` shape.
