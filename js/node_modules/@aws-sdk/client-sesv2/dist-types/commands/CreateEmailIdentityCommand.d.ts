/**
 * <p>Starts the process of verifying an email identity. An <i>identity</i> is
 *             an email address or domain that you use when you send email. Before you can use an
 *             identity to send email, you first have to verify it. By verifying an identity, you
 *             demonstrate that you're the owner of the identity, and that you've given Amazon SES API v2
 *             permission to send email from the identity.</p>
 *         <p>When you verify an email address, Amazon SES sends an email to the address. Your email
 *             address is verified as soon as you follow the link in the verification email.
 *
 *         </p>
 *         <p>When you verify a domain without specifying the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code>
 *             object, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens. You can convert these tokens into
 *             CNAME records, which you then add to the DNS configuration for your domain. Your domain
 *             is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS configuration for your domain.
 *             This verification method is known as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/easy-dkim.html">Easy DKIM</a>.</p>
 *         <p>Alternatively, you can perform the verification process by providing your own
 *             public-private key pair. This verification method is known as Bring Your Own DKIM
 *             (BYODKIM). To use BYODKIM, your call to the <code>CreateEmailIdentity</code> operation
 *             has to include the <code>DkimSigningAttributes</code> object. When you specify this
 *             object, you provide a selector (a component of the DNS record name that identifies the
 *             public key to use for DKIM authentication) and a private key.</p>
 *         <p>When you verify a domain, this operation provides a set of DKIM tokens, which you can
 *             convert into CNAME tokens. You add these CNAME tokens to the DNS configuration for your
 *             domain. Your domain is verified when Amazon SES detects these records in the DNS
 *             configuration for your domain. For some DNS providers, it can take 72 hours or more to
 *             complete the domain verification process.</p>
 *         <p>Additionally, you can associate an existing configuration set with the email identity that you're verifying.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SESv2Client, CreateEmailIdentityCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SESv2Client, CreateEmailIdentityCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SESv2Client(config);
 * const command = new CreateEmailIdentityCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link CreateEmailIdentityCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link CreateEmailIdentityCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SESv2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for SESv2Client's `config` shape.
