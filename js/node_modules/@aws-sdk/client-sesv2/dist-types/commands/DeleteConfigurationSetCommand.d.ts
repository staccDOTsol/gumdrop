 *         <p>
 *             <i>Configuration sets</i> are groups of rules that you can apply to the
 *             emails you send. You apply a configuration set to an email by including a reference to
 *             the configuration set in the headers of the email. When you apply a configuration set to
 *             an email, all of the rules in that configuration set are applied to the email.</p>
 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { SESv2Client, DeleteConfigurationSetCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { SESv2Client, DeleteConfigurationSetCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-sesv2"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new SESv2Client(config);
 * const command = new DeleteConfigurationSetCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteConfigurationSetCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link SESv2ClientResolvedConfig | config} for SESv2Client's `config` shape.
